# AutoComplete TextView in Android

This is a simple Android project that demonstrates how to use **AutoCompleteTextView** with Kotlin. The app suggests a list of cities as the user types, and shows a Toast when a suggestion is selected.

## Features

* AutoCompleteTextView with a threshold (suggestions after 2 characters)
* ArrayAdapter to supply suggestions
* Toast message on item selection

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danger1406/Auto-complete-text-view-in-android.git
   ```
2. Open in Android Studio.
3. Make sure `compileSdk` and `targetSdk` are set to a recent version (e.g., 36).
4. Run on an emulator or device.

## Demo

Type at least two letters in the text field to see city suggestions and select one to view a Toast.
